        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Thai red curry is a classic and beloved dish from Thailand, known for its bold flavors and vibrant colors. It features a creamy and spicy curry sauce made with a base of red curry paste, coconut milk, and an assortment of herbs and spices. Typically, it's cooked with a protein such as chicken, shrimp, or tofu, along with vegetables like bell peppers, bamboo shoots, and eggplant. The curry is simmered until the ingredients are tender and infused with the aromatic flavors of lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime leaves. Served over steamed rice, Thai red curry offers a delicious balance of heat, sweetness, and tanginess that makes it a favorite among food enthusiasts worldwide.
