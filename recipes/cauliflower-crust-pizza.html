        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium head cauliflower (about 4 cups riced cauliflower)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup almond flour or other gluten-free flour</li>
            <li>Spices and seasonings (1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt)</li>
            <li>Pizza toppings (1/2 cup marinara sauce, 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup pepperoni slices, 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms, 1/2 cup sliced bell peppers, 1/4 cup sliced onions, 1/4 cup sliced olives)</li>
            <li>Optional garnishes: Fresh basil leaves, red pepper flakes, grated Parmesan cheese</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet or pizza stone with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Cut the cauliflower into florets and pulse in a food processor until it resembles rice. Microwave the riced cauliflower for 5 minutes, then let it cool.</li>
            <li>Place the cooled cauliflower in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much moisture as possible.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the cauliflower, 2 eggs or flaxseed eggs, 1/2 cup almond flour, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon dried oregano, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cauliflower mixture onto the prepared baking sheet or pizza stone. Use your hands to press it into a thin crust shape, about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Bake the crust in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until golden and crispy around the edges.</li>
            <li>Once the crust is cooked, remove it from the oven and top with marinara sauce, shredded mozzarella cheese, and your favorite pizza toppings.</li>
            <li>Return the pizza to the oven and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven, garnish with fresh basil leaves, red pepper flakes, and grated Parmesan cheese if desired. Slice and serve hot. Enjoy your homemade cauliflower crust pizza!</li>
